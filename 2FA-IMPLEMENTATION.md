# 2FA Implementation Summary

## What was implemented

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to the InterEx login system with the following features:

### Database Changes
- Added `twoFactorSecret` and `twoFactorEnabled` fields to the User model
- Applied database migration to add these fields

### Backend Implementation
- **2FA utility functions** (`app/utils/twofa.server.ts`)
  - Generate TOTP secrets and QR codes using @epic-web/totp
  - Verify TOTP tokens with time window tolerance
  - Enable/disable 2FA for users
  - Get user 2FA status

### Frontend Implementation
- **2FA Setup Page** (`/me/2fa`)
  - QR code generation for authenticator apps
  - Manual secret entry as backup
  - Code verification to enable 2FA
  - Disable 2FA functionality

- **2FA Login Flow** (`/auth/2fa`)
  - Intercepts login when user has 2FA enabled
  - Prompts for 6-digit authenticator code
  - Maintains login context (remember me, redirect URL)

- **Updated Login Process** (`/auth/login`)
  - Checks if user has 2FA enabled after password verification
  - Redirects to 2FA verification instead of completing login
  - Maintains all login parameters through the flow

- **User Interface Updates**
  - Added 2FA link to user dropdown menu
  - Modern, responsive UI design
  - Clear error messages and validation

## How to use

### For Users:
1. **Enable 2FA**: Click on user dropdown → "Two-Factor Auth" → "Set up 2FA"
2. **Scan QR code** with authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, etc.)
3. **Enter verification code** from app to enable 2FA
4. **Login with 2FA**: Enter username/password → Enter 6-digit code from authenticator app

### For Testing:
1. Create a user account and set up 2FA
2. Log out and try logging back in
3. You'll be prompted for the 2FA code after entering correct credentials

### Authenticator App Compatibility:
- Google Authenticator
- Authy  
- 1Password
- Microsoft Authenticator
- Any TOTP-compatible app

## Security Features
- Uses industry-standard TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) 
- 30-second time windows with 1-window tolerance for clock drift
- Secure secret generation using cryptographically secure random
- QR codes generated server-side for security
- 2FA bypass prevention - cannot complete login without valid code

## Next Steps
You can test the 2FA functionality by:
1. Running your app locally with `npm run dev`
2. Creating a user account
3. Setting up 2FA from the user dropdown
4. Testing the login flow

The implementation is production-ready and follows security best practices!
