// Deprecated component: CreateSubmissionDrawer
// This file is intentionally minimized and unused. The original implementation
// was removed to avoid stale, hardcoded file size limits in comments/UI.
// If you need a submission creation UI later, use centralized helpers from
// `#app/utils/upload-constraints.ts`.
