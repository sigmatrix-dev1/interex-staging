## Authentication

The deployment has been simplified to support only username/password plus mandatory TOTP MFA. All OAuth provider code (GitHub strategy, connection management UI/routes, provider onboarding flows) and associated tests were removed to reduce complexity and attack surface. Passkeys (WebAuthn) are presently disabled and slated for future evaluation; related experimental code may still exist under `webauthn+` but is not active in the auth flow.

Rationale:
- Eliminate unused third‚Äëparty auth dependencies and configuration.
- Reduce session complexity (no provider link/unlink edge cases).
- Focus security hardening & test coverage on a single, mandatory MFA path.
