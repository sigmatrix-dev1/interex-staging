# Documentation Migration Notes

Date: 2025-09-27

We consolidated project documentation into the `docs/` folder and created a single comprehensive guide.

Moved and consolidated:
- 2FA-IMPLEMENTATION.md → docs/2FA-IMPLEMENTATION.md
- AUDIT_LOGGING.md → docs/AUDIT_LOGGING.md
- TECHNICAL_SPEC.md → docs/TECHNICAL_SPEC.md
- New: docs/INTEREX_FULL_GUIDE.md (single-file, end-to-end overview)

What to update going forward:
- Add new docs under `docs/`
- Keep `docs/INTEREX_FULL_GUIDE.md` updated for any major feature changes
- Link feature-specific docs from the full guide and README
